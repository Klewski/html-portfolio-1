<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi <br/>
  I'm in my 60's and really wanted to learn something that I didn't understand...and Angela Yu is an amazing
  teacher.

<p>Many years ago I was in the Navy. I ended up getting married and starting a family.
  I figured if I was going to have a family then I definitely wanted to raise my own 
  kids. I've had a job here and there during this time, but nothing career worthy.
  So much for an exciting back story.</p>
